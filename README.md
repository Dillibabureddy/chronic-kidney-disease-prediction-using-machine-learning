# Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to predict **Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)** using Machine Learning techniques. It utilizes a dataset containing patient records with various medical attributes to classify individuals as CKD-positive or CKD-negative. The goal is to develop an accurate predictive model that can assist in early detection and diagnosis.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of medical records containing features such as:
- Age
- Blood Pressure
- Specific Gravity
- Albumin
- Sugar
- Red Blood Cells
- White Blood Cell Count
- Serum Creatinine
- Hemoglobin
- Diabetes Status
- Hypertension Status
- ...and more

The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize data, and encode categorical variables.

## Machine Learning Models Used
Various machine learning models were trained and evaluated, including:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Decision Tree Classifier**
- **XGBoost Classifier**

The model performance was evaluated using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**: Handling missing values, normalizing numerical features, and encoding categorical variables.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing feature distributions, correlations, and outliers.
3. **Feature Selection & Engineering**: Identifying important features using statistical methods.
4. **Model Training & Evaluation**: Training different ML models and comparing their performance.
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing model parameters for better accuracy.
6. **Deployment (Optional)**: Deploying the trained model using Flask or FastAPI.

## Installation & Usage
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn xgboost
```

### Running the Project
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ckd-prediction.git
cd ckd-prediction
```
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script:
```bash
jupyter notebook CKD_Prediction.ipynb
```

## Results
The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of **X%** with a high recall and precision, making it effective in predicting CKD cases.

## Future Improvements
- Incorporating deep learning models for better accuracy.
- Collecting more diverse datasets to improve model generalization.
- Deploying the model as a web application for real-time predictions.
